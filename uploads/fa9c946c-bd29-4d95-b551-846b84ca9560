is she following dave free and not mr. morale you havent seen the kids in six months, the distance is wild dave leaving heart emojis underneath pics of the child speakin of anything with a child, lets get to that now this epstein angle was the shit i expected tiktok videos you collected and dissected instead of being on some dissdirect shit you rather fucking grab your pen and misdirect shit my mom came over today and i was like, mother, i , mother, i , mother ahh, wait a second, thats that one record where you say you got molested aw, fuck me, i just made the whole connection this about to get so depressin this is trauma from your own confessions this when your father leave you home alone with no protection, so neglected thats why these pedophile raps is shit you so obsessed with, its so
